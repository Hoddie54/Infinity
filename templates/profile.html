                    <hr/>
                    <p>I have conducted over 30+ sessions helping my clients get into world class consulting and investment banking firms.</p>
                    <p>My work experience came at IBM in their Global Business Services consulting division.
                        During the year, I was promoted several ranks from my initial position into a senior role, <b>reporting directly to the Head of Sales for UK & Ireland</b> (2nd most senior person in UK).</p>
                    <p>I am the youngest bid manager at IBM, <b>winning two $10m+ clients</b> and project managed two teams of 10 and 12 people respectively, including architects, consultants and HR personnel.</p>
                    <p>I am passionate about helping young people get into their dream careers.
                        My methodology is focussed on identifying the aspirations of the individual and providing firm specific expertise, having built extensive knowledge through helping my clients get into these organisations.</p>
                    <p>My services vary from consulting prep, revamping CV’s and quickfire interview preparation but <b>I love meeting all of my clients for free first</b>, to assess whether or not we might be the right fit, for each other.</p>

                                          My sessions with Azhar were extremely focussed and useful. He broke down exactly how to conduct myself at my IBM interview and show I met the job specification. Our practice interviews improved my ability to give sharp, structured answers with charisma and really identify what to highlight about my previous experiences, in my interview. A huge thanks and couldn’t have got into my role now, without him.

                                          I want to preface this message by highlighting how incredible his insights were. I partnered with Azhar to revise my resume and get a better understanding of the MBB world, and despite having multiple F500 internship experiences, I learned A LOT. Do not sleep on this opportunity.
